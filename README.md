# TaskList
This is a website in which you can plan out your tasks and keep track of them. You can create lists, such as "School" and you can
add a new list will pop up. For each list, you can add as many tasks that you have to complete. After you finish a task you can mark
it as finished and you can even clear any finished tasks. You can also delete any lists you no longer need. All the information is stored
in the local storage so that everytime you open the webpage from your computer, your information will be stored.
