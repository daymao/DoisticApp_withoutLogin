# TaskList
This is a website in which you can create a login and login to an account in which you may create a list for something like groceries or school
and you can add tasks to that list. You can also click on tasks that are completed and they will change to indicate that they are completed. You 
can clear completed tasks and remove lists that you no longer want. The lists are currently stored in the local storage with JSON. The frontend
was made with vanilla javascript and the backend for the login system was made using MongoDB, Express, and Node.js. I styled the webpage to look
nice and smooth to use and I use this app for my daily planning.
